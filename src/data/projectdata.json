    "introText": "This project was done in groups of 4 in the BCIT Front-End Developer program with the goal being to create a movie database that could save a users favorites and display movies from the TMDB API. My group chose to use NextJS and include a database hosted on Supabase to store our favorites instead of using local browser storage. I chose to use a database because then you would be able to sync favorites across multiple devices and not just save them locally.",

Overall I think that this project has given me a lot more respect for game developers and 3D model designers and I learned a lot about programming inside of a 3D scene."
